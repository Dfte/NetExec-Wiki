# üèéÔ∏è v1.3.0 - NeedForSpeed

Hello everyone!

Recently, a lot of incredible Pull Requests have been submitted. Over 22 PRs in 2 weeks! This community activity is incredible, so be prepared for a lot of upcoming features, even if not all of them are included in this release.

Therefore, a big thank you to all the contributors in the past months. Of course, also a big thank you to people who have been submitting issues on github and our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pjwUTQzg8R). This is very important to improve the stability and to ensure everything is working as expected.

## NeedForSpeed - NFS

After quite some time, a new protocol has been added: NFS! This provides the ability to detect NFS servers, enumerate shares recursively. You can also download and upload files with the commands `--get-file` and `--put-file` respectively. Big thanks to [@termanix](https://github.com/termanix) for implementing this protocol, with the help of [@Marshall-Hallenbeck](https://x.com/MJHallenbeck) and [@NeffIsBack](https://x.com/al3x_n3ff).

## SCCM LDAP Reconnaissance

There has been a lot of recent research into Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), also known as Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MECM). Therefore, [@NeffIsBack](https://x.com/al3x_n3ff) developed a module to detect an SCCM environment in Active directory via LDAP! This will find SCCM Site-Servers, SCCM Sites, SCCM Management Points and Users, Computers or Groups related to SCCM.

## coerce\_plus Module

The new coerce\_plus module combines all 5 coercion methods (PetitPotam, DFSCoerce, MSEven, ShadowCoerce and PrinterBug). You can now check all these vulnerabilities with a single module, rather than one by one! If you want to coerce authentications with one of these techniques, just set a LISTENER ip. Made by [@lodos2005](https://github.com/lodos2005).

## Identify Pre-Created Computer Accounts

Pre-WIndows 2000 computer accounts are valuable targets during engagements, as by default the password is set to the computer name. [@Shad0wC0ntr0ller](https://x.com/Shad0wCntr0ller) developed a module to identify these accounts and save a ccache for accounts, where the password was not changed.

## Hunting for passwords in PowerShell Histories

The Powershell History can be a goldmine for credentials. If admins forget to clear their history and passwords are typed in the console, they can be easily extracted. Thanks to [@357384n](https://github.com/357384n) we have a new module, which will check the history of all users on the target for keywords that might get you plaintext credentials.

## Detection for the Guest Session

Unsure about the anonymous authentication? NetExec now has a new flag to detect, if the guest session is active! Thanks to [@Marshall-Hallenbeck](https://x.com/MJHallenbeck) for nice idea.

## Retrieving networks and subnets via new SMB Interfaces flag

The new SMB flag `--interfaces` will enumerate all interfaces on the target. Very useful to find subnets and servers for pivoting! Made by [@Sant0rryu](https://github.com/Sant0rryu).

## Enumerating BitLocker

The new BitLocker module `-M bitlocker` is checking the BitLocker status on all drives. Also this module is available in both WMI and SMB! Made by [@termanix](https://github.com/termanix).

## Enumerate Hyper-V Hosts

Hyper-V saves the Hostname of the hypervisor in the registry. With this module you can query that information from any target VMs. Made by [@joaovarelask](https://x.com/joaovarelas)

## Smbghost Scanning Module

With the new SMB module `-M smbghost`, you can check for prerequisits that have to be enabled for the SMBGhost vulnerability. Made by [@r4anan](https://x.com/r4vanan).
