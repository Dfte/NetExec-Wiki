# NFS escape to root file system

With the recently discovered misconfiguration vulnerability of NFS, access to all system files can be provided via the NFS protocol running on Linux systems. 
ince it would be too long to explain the details of the vulnerability here, you can read the details in the article on this [link](https://www.hvs-consulting.de/en/nfs-security-identifying-and-exploiting-misconfigurations/). 
And of course, thanks to [@NeffIsBack](https://x.com/al3x\_n3ff). For doing deep research on this vulnerability and immediately integrating it into the NFS protocol that was recently added to NetExec.

**Note**: With this update, It changed the working of Download and Upload files usage. Don't forget to look at new usage of [flags](nfs-protocol/Download-and-Upload-Files.md)
